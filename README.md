# Assignment-Repository

################################################

Steps to go through the ui

1) npm i (to be on the safer side)
2) navigation: 
	
	* default route is the ifrst level of assignment
	* '/level2' path for level 2 (verify at app.module.ts)
	
3) Regarding the Bonus question, I tried inplementing it.

	* it gave cors error, that means localhost is not authorised to fetch the data from the server.
	* possible workaround from front-end: Set up a proxy (Have not done it but can be done if required.)
	* from backend we need to allow the corse request (If it is to be fixed from backend.)
	
4) run it by using "ng serve -o"
